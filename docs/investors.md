# Investor Overview

## Executive Summary
DACIT (Decentralized Autonomous Compute & Intelligence Token) is a decentralized infrastructure concept that ties token rewards to measurable utility: edge compute contributions, autonomous conversion optimization, and data/AI improvements. The model is designed to reward real performance rather than speculation.

## Problem
- Web optimization remains slow and manual, limiting conversion gains.
- Centralized cloud infrastructure is expensive and concentrates control.
- Machine learning insights often remain siloed and slow to propagate.
- Most token models reward participation without tying value to outcomes.

## Solution
DACIT introduces a distributed network of edge nodes that:
- Host and optimize web experiences in real time.
- Generate analytics and model improvements at the edge.
- Earn tokens for verifiable compute, data, and optimization outputs.

## Token Utility
Tokens are used for:
- Priority compute cycles and advanced container configurations.
- Premium analytics access and data-driven optimizations.
- Governance and staking participation.

## Market Impact
- Aligns infrastructure incentives with measurable performance improvements.
- Enables a marketplace for AI-driven optimization insights.
- Encourages a decentralized contribution economy with clear reward signals.

## Roadmap (High-Level)
- **Q1 2026:** Protocol specification & token launch
- **Q2 2026:** Testnet deployment & reward algorithm release
- **Q3 2026:** Public testnet with live optimization models
- **Q4 2026:** Mainnet & governance launch
- **2027:** Marketplace rollout & AI model exchange
